/// Starts serving requests coming to this AppEngine application.
///
/// This function will start an HTTP server and will forward new HTTP requests
/// to [handler].
///
/// The [handler] will be executed inside a new request handler zone for every
/// new request. This will isolate different requests from each other.
/// Each [handler] has access to a [ClientContext] using the [context] getter
/// in this library. It can be used to access appengine services, e.g.
/// datastore.
///
/// In case an uncaught error occurs inside the request handler, the request
/// will be closed with an "500 Internal Server Error", if possible, and the
/// given [onError] handler will be called.
///
/// The [onError] function can take either the error object, or the error object
/// and a stack as an argument. If [onError] was not provided, errors will get
/// printed out to the stdout of this process.
///
/// You can provide a [port] if you want to run the HTTP server on a different
/// port than the `8080` default.
///
/// The optional [shared] argument specifies whether additional AppEngine
/// servers can bind to the same `port`. If `shared` is `true` and more
/// AppEngine servers from this isolate or other isolates are bound to the
/// port, then the incoming connections will be distributed among all the bound
/// servers. Connections can be distributed over multiple isolates this way.
///
/// The optional [onAcceptingConnections] callback, if provided, will be
/// notified when the server is accepting connections on [port]. The `address`
/// and `port` arguments that are passed to the callback specify the address
/// and port that the server is listening on.
///
/// The returned `Future` will complete when the HTTP server has been shutdown
/// and is no longer serving requests.

/// - description: 'daily database cleanup job'
///   url: '/tasks/database-cleanup'
///   schedule: 'every 24 hours'
///   target: 'default'

/// an HTTP request to the `default` service for the resource
/// `/tasks/database-cleanup`. In practice anyone can instigate such a request,
/// but AppEngine will send the request from `'10.0.0.1'` and include a special
/// header. This function will validate the origin of the [request] to
/// ensure that it does indeed originate from
/// [AppEngine's cron job scheduler][1].
